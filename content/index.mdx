Welcome to my personal website.

I'm a creative technical architect consultant who helps customers to:

- design and implement their microservices in a resilient, responsive and elastic architecture.
- design and implement their DevOps pipeline according to their requirements like security, audit, segregation.

I participate in the whole workflow chain **from architecture design to code implementation**.

I'm used to work in an **agile iterative way** - usually in scrum or kanban - with high focus on delivering usable increments to speed up adoption 
and get quick feedback for continuous improvements.

What I like the most in my job is to learn new technologies to fill my toolbox so that I can pick the right tool to solve your needs.

When I can, I also try to contribute back to open source technologies I use. Do not hesitate to check my <a href={props.author.github}>Github</a> to know more.

If you want to know more about my experiences, please visit my <a href={props.author.linkedin}>Linked'In profile</a>. I try to keep it up-to-date regularly :wink:.
