Welcome to my personal website.

I'm technical architect consultant who helps customers to:

- design and implement their microservices in a resilient, responsive and scalable architecture.
- design and implement their DevOps pipeline according to their requirements (security, audit, segregation, etc.)

I participate in the whole workflow chain **from architecture design to code implementation**.

I'm used to work in an iterative way, usually in scrum or kanban, with high focus on delivering directly usable increments to speed up adoption 
and continuously improving from feedback.
