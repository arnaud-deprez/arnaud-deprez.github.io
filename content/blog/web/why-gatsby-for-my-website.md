As I've just created this website, I would like to use this first post to share my experience on using Gatsby and Netlify to build this.
The goal is not explain how to get started with Gatsby, there are already a lot of other blog posts and the documentation is clear enough.
So if you are comparing Gatsby against other JAMStack solution, you can already keep in mind that even if it is relatively new compared to others, there is a very helpful and large community and the documentation is great as well.

## My requirements

## What is Gatsby ?

### Why Gatsby ?

#### Because

#### I got high

## Conclusion
